Consumer prices. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ widely-cited Consumer Price Index measures “the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.” In addition to overall averages, the index provides decades of detailed data on monthly price changes for hundreds of sub-baskets, ranging from broad groupings (e.g., apparel, housing, education) to narrower categories (e.g., frozen vegetables, window coverings, veterinarian services).
